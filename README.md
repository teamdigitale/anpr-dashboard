# ANPR Dashboard (stato-migrazione)

The ANPR dashboard is a static, web application that reads data from two local json files ([dashboardData.json](dashboardData.json) and [previsioni.json](previsioni.json)) and represents them in form of charts in a web page.

## Requirements

The assets produced by the builds can run on any web server able to serve static content (html, js and css files).

To build and minify the source files, thus making them ready for being deployed, or to run a local development server, you'll need the following tools:

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) - any version should be fine, although at the moment of the writing we're using 11.10. This is needed by NPM (below)

* [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). This is the package manager used to install dependencies

## Build and minify for deployments

To build and minify the source code, thus making it ready for deployments (final artifact can be copied as is to a web server), simply run:

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and minify
npm run build
```

You should find the new minified assets in the *docs* folder of this repository.

The dashboard website is currently deployed through [GitHub pages](https://github.com/teamdigitale/anpr-dashboard), which automatically "renders" the files in the *docs* directory (produced by the build process described above).

## Run and test the application locally

The paragraph describes how to run the application locally for development purposes.

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the assets and minify with gulp.
# Then, start the local development server
npm start
```

You should now be able to see the dashboard opening a browser and pointing it to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Update data sources and automation

The application makes use of two local data sources ([dashboardData.json](dashboardData.json) and [previsioni.json](previsioni.json)), located in the root of the repository. The two files already present in the repository should reflect the last ones uploaded, that the website is showing to users. In order to show new data, you'll need to change the files in the root directory, run the build once again, and push to GitHub the changes.

The process is fully automated through [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), which every hour runs a [custom pipeline](.circleci/config.yml) that:

* Downloads the latest files (if not found, it keeps the local ones)

* Builds the assets and minifies

* Pushes the changes to the GitHub repository
